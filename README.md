This project is for my final paper from course POLS-GR8768. The final paper is the pdf file named "Multi_armed_bandit_problem_in_marketing_Siyi_Gao .pdf".

The repository stores the simulation study codes and social network file.  


There are 5000 replications for each study. 

All the python files that I finally use when writing the paper are uploaded here. 

Since it takes a very long time to run 5000 replications for each experiment, I split them into different files. 

The class MAB and network_MAB contains both TS and static design method. 

For all files, these two classes are unchanged. Only the parameters vary.
